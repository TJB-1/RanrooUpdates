                    Borderlands 3 continues to get bigger, and alongside the reveal trailer for its second campaign add-on Guns, Love, and Tentacles:
                     The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock, Gearbox Software has also shared a teaser image for a third DLC expansion.
                    This one will take things in two very different directions, featuring revolver-toting outlaws as well as dinosaurs.
                    Announced as part of its PAX East news, the third campaign add-on hasn't
                     been fully detailed yet, but it will arrive this summer.
                     It's included with the Borderlands 3 Season Pass, and as the image shows outlaws riding on dinosaurs,
                      it should be every bit as goofy and over-the-top as Borderlands fans expect.
                    Gearbox also recently shared that Borderlands 3's Epic Games Store PC exclusivity will be ending on March 13.
                     At that point, the game will be available to play on Steam, and it will support cross-platform play between the two platforms.
                      A few weeks after its Steam launch, the Guns, Love, and Tentacles expansion will be out,
                      so you best not dillydally if you want to get through the campaign first.
                    In April, Borderlands 3 will be getting Mayhem Mode 2.0 as a free update,
                    along with updated modifiers and new loot. There will also be a free event in April called Revenge of the Cartels
                    that will feature unique rewards, and the Guardian Takedown event in May will also offer free content like bosses and cosmetics.
                    Jordan Ramée praised the base game's freedom in GameSpot's Borderlands 3 review,
                    as well as the new environments and character classes. Alongside PC,
                     Borderlands 3 is available on Xbox One, PS4, and Google Stadia.
                     The official Borderlands movie recently found a director in Eli Roth,
                     who wants to have cosplayers act--and die--in the film.
